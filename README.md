## Project 01: 
Infrastructure and API Deployment for Data Science Application on AWS with Terraform.
### Directorio:
aws/Lab1
### Description:
The main objective of this project is to develop and implement a cloud infrastructure solution using Terraform to host a Data Science application on AWS. This application will focus on a Machine Learning (ML) model designed to predict whether customers will make new purchases based on their spending history.
### Specifications:
#### ML Model Development:
- Build a Machine Learning model that uses historical customer purchase data to predict future purchasing actions.
- Ensure model accuracy and efficiency.
#### Infrastructure Implementation on AWS:
- Use AWS services to host and run the application, including Amazon EC2, S3 and IAM.
- Ensure security, scalability and high availability of infrastructure.
#### Automation with Terraform:
- Employ Terraform to automate infrastructure deployment on AWS, ensuring consistent and efficient deployment.
- Document Terraform code for easier maintenance and future updates.
#### API development:
- Create an API to integrate the ML model with the front-end application.
- Ensure the API is secure, scalable and easy to use.
### Tools
- AWS;
- Terraform.
